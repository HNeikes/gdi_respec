## [Dataset](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Dataset)

A conceptual entity that represents the information published. <br><br>
`Usage note`: When focusing on health data, a dataset typically contains structured information gathered from a study or research project related to health topics. This might include clinical trial results, public health statistics, patient records, survey data, etc. <br> How the data in a dataset can be accessed is defined in the [Distribution](linkto:distribution), which usually points to the actual data files available for access or download. Datasets are often included in a catalog, which organizes and provides metadata about multiple datasets, making them easier to find and use. The term 'agent' refers to any entity responsible for creating, maintaining, or distributing the dataset.

### Mandatory Properties

| **Property name** | **Definition** | **URI** | **Controlled Vocabulary** | **rdfs:Range** | **Usage Note** | **Cardinality** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [access rights](http://purl.org/dc/terms/accessRights) | Information about who accesses the resource or an indication of its security status. | `dct:accessRights` | [EU Vocabularies Access Rights Authority List](http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/access-right) | [Rights Statement (IRI)](http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/access-right) | Information that indicates whether the Dataset is publicly accessible, has access restrictions, or is not public. It is foreseen that one of the three options has to be used: `public`, `restricted`, `non-public`. <br> - Open Data (Public): The dataset is available under general open data rules, such as those covered by the High Value Datasets Implementing Regulation. <br> - Protected Data (Restricted): The dataset contains protected data and is accessible only under specific conditions, as outlined in regulations like the Data Governance Act. <br> - Sensitive Data (Non public): The dataset includes resources that may contain sensitive or personal information, falling under regulations such as the EHDS Regulation. <br><br> Since most data contain personal information, these datasets will need to take the value 'non-public' for the access rights property. | 1 | `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/access-right/RESTRICTED` |
| [applicable legislation](http://data.europa.eu/r5r/applicableLegislation) | The legislation that is applicable to this resource. | `dcatap:applicableLegislation` | NA | `eli:LegalResource` | The ELI of the EHDS was published in March 2025 and can now be included as the applicable legislation mandating that the dataset has to be made public. <br> For health datasets, the value must include the ELI of the [EHDS Regulation](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj). <br> As multiple legislations may apply to the resource, the maximum cardinality is not limited. <br><br> While the applicable legislation indicates which legislation mandates the publication of the dataset, the legal basis property (also in Datasets) described the legal basis for initial collection and processing of (personal) data. | 1..\* | NA |
| [contact point](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_contact_point) | Relevant contact information for the cataloged resource. | `dcat:contactPoint` | NA | `vcard:Kind` | This property points to a contact point (department or person) that can answer questions about the dataset. Details on how to describe these are provided under class `vcard:Kind`. <br>Whenever possible, use **general contact information** (for example from a department) instead of contact information of an individual. | 1 | mailto: `data-access-committee@xumc.nl` <br> with the name Data Access Committee of the x UMC (see [vcard:Kind](linkto:kind)) |

For datasets, this is typically the employer of the data creators. In simple cases, the dataset publisher may be the same as the catalog publisher. In more complex settings, such as when datasets come from multiple institutions within a consortium, the consortium should be listed as the publisher where possible. If no formal consortium can be specified, provide the information of the contributing organizations or individuals under `dct:creator` instead. For more details, refer to the [Agent](linkto:agent) class. | 1 | Radboud University Medical Center; identifier `https://ror.org/05wg1m734` (see foaf: Agent) |
