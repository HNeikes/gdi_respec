## [Data Service](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#DataService)

A collection of operations that provides access to one or more datasets or data processing functions. <br><br>
`Usage note`: A Data service offers the possibility to access and query the data of one (or several datasets) through operations. It offers more extensive possibilities to access the data than the [Distribution](linkto:distribution) through a variety of potential actions. An example of a Data Service is a [Beacon API](https://docs.genomebeacons.org/) to query genomics data.

| [publisher](http://purl.org/dc/terms/publisher) | An entity responsible for making the resource available. | `dct:publisher` | NA | `foaf:Agent` | The organisation or individual responsible for making the data service available. In the context of data services, the publisher is typically the organisation that manages or provides access to the service.

In the Health Data Catalogue, most data services will use `NAL:data-theme` 'HEAL', but additional values from the same vocabulary are allowed. | 1..\* | `https://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/data-theme/HEAL` |
| [title](http://purl.org/dc/terms/title) | A name given to the resource. | `dct:title` | NA | `rdfs:Literal` | NA | 1..\* | NA |

| [application profile](http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo) | An established standard to which the described resource conforms. | `dct:conformsTo` | NA | `dct:Standard` | The standards referred here SHOULD describe the Data Service and not the data it serves.
