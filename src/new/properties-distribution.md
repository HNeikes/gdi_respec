### [Distribution](http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Distribution)

A physical embodiment of the Dataset in a particular format. <br><br>
`Usage note`: Used to describe the different ways that a single dataset can be made available in. I.e., it can be downloaded, or it can be accessed online in one or more distributions (e.g. one in a downloadable `.csv` file, another file with an access or query webpage)

#### Mandatory Properties

| **Property name** | **Definition** | **URI** | **Controlled Vocabulary** | **rdfs:Range** | **Usage Note** | **Cardinality** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [access URL](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:distribution_access_url) | A URL of the resource that gives access to a distribution of the dataset. E.g., landing page, feed, SPARQL endpoint. | `dcat:accessURL` | NA | `IRI` | Add a link that points to where the dataset can be found. If it's hosted in a Data Repository, include the link to its entry. For datasets not in a repository (like registries), but still available for secondary use, provide a link to an access request form or a webpage with instructions for accessing the data. | 1 | NA |
| [byte size](https://semiceu.github.io/DCAT-AP/releases/3.0.0/#Distribution.bytesize) | The size of a Distribution in bytes. | `dcat:byteSize` | NA | `xsd:nonNegativeInteger` | Describes the size of the distribution (the actual file) in bytes, and is therefore expressed as a non-negative integer. If the actual size is not know, it can be estimated. | 1 | NA |
| [format](http://purl.org/dc/terms/format) | The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the resource. | `dct:format` | [EU Vocabularies File Type Authority List](http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/file-type) | `dct:MediaType or Extent` | This property can be used to describe a media format in more detail than `media type` (using IANA media type) when needed. Instances of this property should use a URL, e.g., from the [File Type vocabulary](https://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/file-type). For instance, for mzML files, the value of this property could be: `http://edamontology.org/format_3244` | 1 | `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/file-type/TSV` |
| [license](http://purl.org/dc/terms/license) | A legal document giving official permission to do something with the resource. | `dct:license` | [Geonovum licence list](https://definities.geostandaarden.nl/dcat-ap-nl/nl/) | `dct:LicenseDocument` | For public data, use a Creative Commons (CC) license (see [Geonovum options](https://definities.geostandaarden.nl/dcat-ap-nl/nl/)). For most National Health Data Catalogue distributions, where data is not public, use the 'not open' license from Geonovum and specify data reuse agreements in the `dct:rights` property. | 1 | NA |
| [rights](http://purl.org/dc/terms/rights) | Information about rights held in and over the resource. | `dct:rights` | NA | `dct:RightsStatement` | A statement that concerns all rights not addressed in fields `license` or `access rights`. In case of not open data (as specified in the `dct:licence` property), further agreements regarding data reuse (e.g., Data Transfer Agreement, DTA) should be stated in this property. <br> The rights statement should be a free-text statement placed at a web-accessible location such that the value of this property is the IRI pointing to that statement. <br> Current status: This recommendation on how to state data transfer/reuse conditions will be piloted in 2025. | 1 | NA |
